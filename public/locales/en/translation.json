I used React with Vite to ensure fast loading, along with Redux and Axios to handle data and API requests efficiently. \n\n  Our API integrates with Google Maps Platform to provide real-time precise location services, enhancing the accuracy of your moving service. When a customer requests a quote, the system: \n - Automatically suggests pickup and destination addresses through Google Maps autocomplete, preventing input errors. \n - Validates locations to ensure accessibility (e.g., 123 Main Street, Sydney, NSW ‚Üí exact coordinates).\n - Calculates optimized moving routes with traffic and toll considerations. \n\n My goal was to create a professional, clear and fluid user experience, aligned with current web development standards.",
